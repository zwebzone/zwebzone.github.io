I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the collaborative program between Southern University of Science and Technology (<font color=#ed6c00><strong>SUS</strong></font><font color=#004246><strong>Tech</strong></font>) and City University of Hong Kong (<font color=#bf165e><strong>CityUHK</strong></font>), where I am working under the dual supervision of Professors [Yu Zhang](https://yuzhanghk.github.io/) (张宇) and [Ying Wei](https://wei-ying.net/) (魏颖). My research primarily focuses on Transfer Learning, Meta-Learning, Deep Generative Models and AI for Science.

Prior to this, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from <font color=#ed6c00><strong>SUS</strong></font><font color=#004246><strong>Tech</strong></font> in 2022, under the supervision of Professor [Xuan Song](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/songx) (宋轩).
