I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the City University of Hong Kong (<font color=#bf165e><strong>CityUHK</strong></font>) and advised by Professors [Yu Zhang](https://yuzhanghk.github.io/) (Âº†ÂÆá), [Ying Wei](https://wei-ying.net/) (È≠èÈ¢ñ), and [Kede Ma](https://kedema.org/) (È©¨ÊüØÂæ∑). Prior to this, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from <font color=#ed6c00><strong>SUS</strong></font><font color=#004246><strong>Tech</strong></font> in 2022, under the supervision of Professor [Xuan Song](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/songx) (ÂÆãËΩ©). My research mainly focuses on improving the efficiency and adaptability of large-scale AI models, particularly in LLMs (PEFT,RLVR,KVCache), deep generative models, transfer learning (continual learning, meta-learning, and domain adaptation), and AI for science.
